Q8)
We want to represent the graph G mentioned in previous question, in memory either as an Adjacency matrix or Adjacency list. Assume that each cell in the adjacency matrix takes 4 bytes of memory and each edge representation in the adjacency list occupies 8 bytes of memory(you can ignore all other factors that occupy memory). 
What will be the amount of memory required to represent graph G using Adjacency matrix and Adjacency List respectively? (This is follow up question for question 7)
